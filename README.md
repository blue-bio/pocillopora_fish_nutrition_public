This study investigated the effects of co-culturing Pocillopora verrucosa corals with schools of juvenile Chromis viridis damselfish and a supply of live feeds. The status of the captive cultured P. verrucosa was also compared to the same colonyâ€™s status in the field prior to collection, and after 1.5 months acclimation to captive conditions. 

Proximate, lipid class and fatty acid composition were assessed for the corals and diets, and microbial communities were assessed using 16S RNA sequencing.
